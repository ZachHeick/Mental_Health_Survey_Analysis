# About the Dataset and Why I Chose It  

I found an interesting dataset on survey results regarding mental health in the workplace, focusing on tech. This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. From what I observed while getting my computer science degree, talking with students and friends working in the industry, and reading comments online, I'm curious to how tech companies view mental illness and health. I'm also specifically interested in seeing if employees will seek treatment.
